-- REKKIES CLUB — schema
--
-- This table makes chat PERMANENT: history loads when a room opens, every
-- member message is saved, and a message stays saved until its author deletes
-- it. (Profiles still use Supabase Auth, and live chat + presence still run
-- over Supabase Realtime — those need no table.)
--
-- Run this once in the Supabase SQL Editor (Project: ejhhjzamdittnbfvxsfx).
-- The publishable key can't run DDL, so it's applied from the dashboard (or
-- once via a Management API PAT). Re-running is safe — everything is guarded
-- with "if not exists" / "drop policy if exists".

-- ---- messages: the chat inside each room ----
-- channel_id is just the room's string id from app.js (e.g. 'main',
-- 'introductions', 'music-production'). Rooms are defined in the client, so no
-- separate channels table is needed.
